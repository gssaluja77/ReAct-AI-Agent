# ReAct-based AI Agent

Developed a ReAct style AI agent using Python that can analyze and modify files in a project folder, enhancing my understanding of file I/O, prompt handling, and code generation.

**How to run:**

- Install the uv package manager using `pip install uv` or `brew install uv`
- Install latest (or >3.14) version of Python using `uv python install`
- Create a virtual environment with `uv venv` and activate it using `source .venv/bin/activate`
- In the root directory of the project, run the command `uv run main.py`
- Ask the agent something like:
  - Show me what files are there in the project
  - Or any general knowlege based like: Why is the sky blue?
